# The Cafe Experience

This is one of my first programming projects, a text rpg / coffee shop simulator. Since I find this idea fun, it motivates me to drill new skills as I try to solve problems and implement new features in the game. The game is in development as I learn how to do more with Python.

# Gameplay

The player starts with $20 in their wallet with which they can purchase drinks, which cost a randomly generated amount each time you order. When you run out of money and can't order any more drinks, the game is over, and your score is however many drinks you managed to buy. Depending on how you play the game, such as how nice you are to the barista and if you are able to find hidden money around the cafe, you can increase your score, although some luck is always involved because of the random price of drinks.
