# This is one of my first programming projects. I'm using this silly idea of a coffeeshop simulator game as a motivating space to apply and practice new skills as I'm learning Python.
# The game started off where you just order a coffee and it lets you input different options to customize.
# The latest iteration now is an almost complete game. The goal is to purchase as many beverages at the cafe as you can. You start off with a set amount of money and drinks cost
# a random amount each time you order, so there's some luck involved. But you can also hunt around the cafe, text rpg style, to find some extra money. And tipping the barista might
# work in your favor...
# The game is intentionally silly, it makes it fun to practice skills and learn even more through problem-solving trying to make certain things happen in the game.
# I'm especially happy to have recently learned enough to be able to program a working wallet and payment system, as well as tracking things like your usual drink, what drink you're
# currently sipping on, and how the barista feels about you based on if you're a regular tipper.
